# A personal finance

This is a personal finance project that I am working on. The goal is to create a simple and easy to use personal finance tool that can help me track my expenses and income.

## Objective

The principle reason for this project is to help me track my expenses and income. I want to be able to see how much I am spending and how much I am earning. I also want to be able to see how much I have spent and how much I have earned in a given month or year.

## Why not use an existing tool?

I have tried using existing tools, but do not provide the information that I need.

### Why not use a spreadsheet?

The next step is to create a finance tool that can help me understanding my BTC allocations, it is not possible to do this with a spreadsheet.
